The reader must be familiar with how the differential (i.e., pushforward map) is defined on a general manifold for much of this to make any sense. I will also rely extensively on the interpretation of tangent vectors as equivalence classes of curves ; Wikipedia has an excellent summary of this, as does my blog (if I may say so myself).\nI am interested in the differentials of the maps $\\exp: \\mathfrak g \\rightarrow G$ and $\\log:U\\rightarrow \\mathfrak g$, where $U\\subseteq G$ is a neighborhood of $e$. Let $L_g$ refer to the left-multiplication operation: $L_g(h)=gh$ for $g,h\\in G$. Given $X\\in\\mathfrak g$, $X^L_g\\coloneqq dL_g(X)$ is the corresponding left-invariant vector field. For a matrix Lie group (i.e., where $g$ is identified with some finite-dimensional matrix representation of it), $X^L_g=g X$, which makes sense because we have an external algebraic structure (namely, the multiplication of $n\\times n$ matrices, which has the structure of an associative unital algebra ) that lets us multiply group elements with Lie algebra elements. This rather convenient structure does not exist for a general Lie group.\nDifferential of $\\exp$ Suppose $\\exp(X)$ is a point on $G$. The differential of $\\exp$ provides an answer to the following question: what happens when $X$ is perturbed in the direction $Y \\in T_{X}\\mathfrak g$? The result, referred to as the pushforward of $Y$ under $\\exp$, lies in $T_{\\exp(X)} G$. That is, the differential is a linear map between vector spaces:\n\\[ d\\exp_X: T_{X}\\mathfrak g \\rightarrow T_{\\exp X} G. \\] Since $\\mathfrak g$ is a vector space, we can identify $T_X\\mathfrak g$ with $\\mathfrak g$. Similarly, we can identity $T_{\\exp X} G$ with $T_e G$, which is also just $\\mathfrak g$. A pedagogical nightmare ensues.\nLet $\\gamma(t)$ be a curve on $\\mathfrak g$. We use the notation $[\\gamma]$ to refer to the equivalence class of all the curves1 that pass through $\\gamma(0)$ with the velocity $\\dot \\gamma(0)$.2 We say that $\\gamma$ is a representative of the class $[\\gamma]$. If $\\gamma$ is chosen such that $\\gamma(0)=X\\in\\mathfrak g$ and $\\dot \\gamma(0)=Y \\in T_X\\mathfrak g$, then $[\\gamma]$ is completely characterized by $Y$ and vice versa; therefore, we can write $[\\gamma]=Y$. The curve $\\gamma$ is a representative of $Y$.\nThe image of $\\gamma$ under $\\exp$, which is $\\exp\\circ \\gamma(t)$, is a curve on $G$ which represents the pushforward of $Y$. That is, $$d\\exp_X(Y)=[\\hspace{2pt}\\exp\\circ \\hspace{1pt}\\gamma\\hspace{2pt}]$$\nis some vector in $T_{\\exp(X)} G$. But which vector?\nThe key to making these identifications concrete is to notice that we can choose any $\\gamma$ satisfying $\\gamma(0)=X$ and $\\dot {\\gamma}(0)=Y$. Any such $\\gamma$ is a representative of $Y$. So, we might as well choose a $\\gamma$ that is convenient to write down; let’s make the choice, $\\gamma(t) \\coloneqq X+tY$.\nNow, $\\exp \\circ\\hspace{2pt} \\gamma(t)=\\exp(X+tY)$ is a curve on $G$ passing through $\\exp(X)$, and it is also a member of its equivalence class $[\\exp(X+tY)]$. But consider this alternative way of writing down the same equivalence class:\n$$ \\big[\\exp(X+tY)\\big]=\\big[\\exp(X)\\exp(t\\hspace{2pt}\\square)\\big] $$\nwhere the box is a Lie algebra element: $\\square \\in \\mathfrak g$. There must be a value of $\\square$ for which these are the same equivalence class. The value of $\\square$ can therefore be used to describe the quantity $d\\exp_X(Y)$:\n$$ d\\exp_X(Y)=\\big[\\exp(X+tY)\\big]=\\big[\\exp(X)\\exp(t\\hspace{2pt}\\square)\\big]. $$\nIn conclusion, the differential of $\\exp$ takes two objects, the point $X$ and the direction $Y$, and defines the object $\\square$. Here, $\\square$ represents the direction and extent to which $\\exp(X)$ is perturbed when we nudge $X$ in the direction of $Y$.\nIn the case of matrix Lie groups, we write $d\\exp_X(Y)=\\exp(X)\\square$, although the reader should now understand what this really means and how one might go about deriving the formula for $\\square$. Section 3.2 of Jean Gallier's book has the formula for $d\\exp_X$, and the appendix of my paper \"Parameter Estimation on Homogeneous Spaces\" has $d\\log_{\\exp(X)}$. Differential of $\\log$ By the same arguments as above,\n$$ d\\log_g: T_g G \\rightarrow T_{\\log(g)}\\mathfrak g. $$\nSince $T_g G\\cong \\mathfrak g$ and $T_{\\log(g)}\\mathfrak g\\cong \\mathfrak g$, we should once again expect a formula that goes from $\\mathfrak g$ to $\\mathfrak g$. It proves to be convenient to work entirely with $\\mathfrak g$-elements and write $\\exp(X)$ in place of $g$.\nLet $\\gamma \\coloneqq \\exp(X) \\exp(tY)$ by a curve passing through $\\exp(X)$ with the velocity $Y$. We have, $$d\\log_{\\exp(X)}(Y)=\\big[\\hspace{1pt}\\log\\mathrel\\circ\\gamma\\hspace{1pt}(t)\\hspace{1pt}\\big]=\\big[\\hspace{1pt}\\log\\big(\\exp(X)\\exp(tY)\\big)\\hspace{1pt}\\big]$$ One sees the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff-Dynkin formula starting to appear. As before, we have an alternative way of writing down the equivalence class:\n$$ \\big[\\hspace{1pt}\\log\\big(\\exp(X)\\exp(tY)\\big)\\hspace{1pt}\\big]= \\big[\\hspace{1pt}X + t\\hspace{1pt}\\square\\hspace{1pt}\\big]. $$\nThus, the differential of $\\log$ takes two objects, $g$ (alternatively, $X=\\log(g)$) and $Y$, and its output is characterized by $\\square$. Here, $\\square$ is the direction in which $\\log(g)$ is perturbed when we perturb its argument, $g$, in the direction $Y$.\nDifferential of … In equation $(5)$ of this paper , the authors use the result that\n\\[ \\textrm{grad}_x d^2(x,y) = -2 \\log_x (y). \\] This makes intuitive sense, and the proof of it goes through some variant of the Gauss lemma. An analogous result holds on Lie groups with the distance defined in a group-theoretic manner. The group-theoretic ‘distance’ isn’t necessarily a distance that arises from a Riemannian metric (i.e., the geodesic distance), however, so we should try to prove it without passing through the Gauss lemma.\nLet $f(g) = \\lVert \\log h^{-1} g \\rVert_2 ^2$. We want to compute its gradient w.r.t. a left-invariant Riemannian metric on $G$, $\\langle\\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$. Let $\\tilde Z \\in \\mathfrak g$ with $Z_g \\coloneqq d L_g (\\tilde Z)$ denoting the corresponding left-invariant vector field (LIVF). Furthermore, let $\\mathfrak{grad}f_g \\coloneqq dL_{g^{-1}}\\left(\\textrm{grad}f_g\\right)$ denote the trivialization of the gradient. The gradient of $f$ can then be characterized as:\n\\[ \\begin{align*} \\langle \\mathfrak{grad}f_\\mu, \\tilde Z \\rangle = \\langle dL_{\\mu^{-1}}\\left(\\textrm{grad}f_\\mu\\right), \\tilde Z \\rangle = \\langle \\textrm{grad}f_{\\mu}, \\tilde Z \\rangle = Zf(\\mu). \\end{align*} \\] which should hold for an arbitrary $\\tilde Z$. We further decompose this function as $f= f_1 \\circ f_2$ ($f_1$ after $f_2$) where $f_1:\\mathfrak g \\rightarrow \\mathbb R_{\\geq 0}$ and $f_2:G \\rightarrow \\mathfrak g$ in the obvious way. This means that\n\\[ \\begin{align*} Zf(\\mu) \u0026= This is also what is called a $1$- jet , and this notion of an ’equivalence class of curves’ generalizes in annoying ways. ↩︎\nHere, $\\dot \\gamma(0)$ refers to the pushforward of $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\big\\vert_{t=0}$ under $\\gamma$. ↩︎\n",

<p>I am interested in the differentials of the maps $\exp: \mathfrak g \rightarrow G$<!-- (surjective if the group is connected, injective when $G=\mathbb R^n$) -->
and $\log:U\rightarrow \mathfrak g$, where $U\subseteq G$ is a neighborhood of $e$.
Let $L_g$ refer to the left-multiplication operation: $L_g(h)=gh$ for $g,h\in G$. Given $X\in\mathfrak g$, $X^L_g\coloneqq dL_g(X)$ is the corresponding left-invariant vector field.

</a> of all the curves<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> that pass through $\gamma(0)$ with the velocity $\dot \gamma(0)$.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> We say that $\gamma$ is a <span class=accented>representative</span> of the class $[\gamma]$.
If $\gamma$ is chosen such that $\gamma(0)=X\in\mathfrak g$ and $\dot \gamma(0)=Y \in T_X\mathfrak g$, then $[\gamma]$ is completely characterized by $Y$ and vice versa; therefore, we can write $[\gamma]=Y$. The curve $\gamma$ is a representative of $Y$.</p>
<p>The image of $\gamma$ under $\exp$, which is <span class=accented>$\exp\circ \gamma(t)$</span>, is a curve on $G$ which represents the pushforward of $Y$. That is,
$$d\exp_X(Y)=[\hspace{2pt}\exp\circ \hspace{1pt}\gamma\hspace{2pt}]$$</p>
<!-- <aside class=aside-right>
</aside> -->
<p>is some vector in $T_{\exp(X)} G$. But which vector?</p>
<!-- In what follows, one can also read '$[\,\cdot\,]$' as "to the first order in $t$", resting assured that there is a precise meaning\footnote{$\ldots$either by way of *jets*, or by considering the actions of tangent vectors on functions.} for what this means. -->
<!-- Let's simply write $Y=[\gamma]$, then $d\exp_X(Y)=[\exp\circ \gamma]$. -->
<p>The key to making these identifications concrete is to notice that we can choose <em>any</em> $\gamma$ satisfying $\gamma(0)=X$ and $\dot {\gamma}(0)=Y$.
<strong>Any</strong> such $\gamma$ is a representative of $Y$.
So, we might as well choose a $\gamma$ that is convenient to write down; let&rsquo;s make the choice, $\gamma(t) \coloneqq X+tY$.</p>
<p>Now, $\exp \circ\hspace{2pt} \gamma(t)=\exp(X+tY)$ is a curve on $G$ passing through $\exp(X)$, and it is also a member of its equivalence class $[\exp(X+tY)]$.
But consider this alternative way of writing down the same equivalence class:</p>
<p>$$
\big[\exp(X+tY)\big]=\big[\exp(X)\exp(t\hspace{2pt}\square)\big]
$$</p>
<p>where the box is a Lie algebra element: $\square \in \mathfrak g$. There must be a value of $\square$ for which these are the same equivalence class. The value of $\square$ can therefore be used to <u>describe</u> the quantity $d\exp_X(Y)$:</p>
<p>$$
d\exp_X(Y)=\big[\exp(X+tY)\big]=\big[\exp(X)\exp(t\hspace{2pt}\square)\big].
$$</p>
<p>In conclusion, the differential of $\exp$ takes two objects, the point $X$ and the direction $Y$, and defines the object $\square$. Here, $\square$ represents the direction and extent to which $\exp(X)$ is perturbed when we nudge $X$ in the direction of $Y$.</p>
<aside class=aside-center>
In the case of matrix Lie groups, we write $d\exp_X(Y)=\exp(X)\square$, although the reader should now understand what this <i>really</i> means and how one might go about deriving the formula for $\square$.
Section 3.2 of Jean Gallier's book has the formula for $d\exp_X$, and the appendix of my paper "<i>Parameter Estimation on Homogeneous Spaces</i>" has $d\log_{\exp(X)}$.

<p>By the same arguments as above,</p>
<p>$$
d\log_g: T_g G \rightarrow T_{\log(g)}\mathfrak g.
$$</p>
<p>Since $T_g G\cong \mathfrak g$ and $T_{\log(g)}\mathfrak g\cong \mathfrak g$, we should once again expect a formula that goes from $\mathfrak g$ to $\mathfrak g$.
It proves to be convenient to work entirely with $\mathfrak g$-elements and write $\exp(X)$ in place of $g$.</p>
<p>Let $\gamma \coloneqq \exp(X) \exp(tY)$ by a curve passing through $\exp(X)$ with the velocity $Y$. We have,
$$d\log_{\exp(X)}(Y)=\big[\hspace{1pt}\log\mathrel\circ\gamma\hspace{1pt}(t)\hspace{1pt}\big]=\big[\hspace{1pt}\log\big(\exp(X)\exp(tY)\big)\hspace{1pt}\big]$$
One sees the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff-Dynkin formula starting to appear. As before, we have an alternative way of writing down the equivalence class:</p>
<p>$$
\big[\hspace{1pt}\log\big(\exp(X)\exp(tY)\big)\hspace{1pt}\big]= \big[\hspace{1pt}X + t\hspace{1pt}\square\hspace{1pt}\big].
$$</p>
<p>Thus, the differential of $\log$ takes two objects, $g$ (alternatively, $X=\log(g)$) and $Y$, and its output is characterized by $\square$. Here, $\square$ is the direction in which $\log(g)$ is perturbed when we perturb its argument, $g$, in the direction $Y$.</p>

</a>, the authors use the result that</p>
<p>
\[
\textrm{grad}_x d^2(x,y) = -2 \log_x (y).
\]
</p>
<p>This makes intuitive sense, and the proof of it goes through some variant of the Gauss lemma. An analogous result holds on Lie groups with the distance defined in a group-theoretic manner. The group-theoretic &lsquo;distance&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t necessarily a distance that arises from a Riemannian metric (i.e., the geodesic distance), however, so we should try to prove it without passing through the Gauss lemma.</p>
<p>Let $f(g) = \lVert \log h^{-1} g \rVert_2 ^2$. We want to compute its gradient w.r.t. a left-invariant Riemannian metric on $G$, $\langle\cdot, \cdot \rangle$.
Let $\tilde Z \in \mathfrak g$ with $Z_g \coloneqq d L_g (\tilde Z)$ denoting the corresponding left-invariant vector field (LIVF). Furthermore, let $\mathfrak{grad}f_g \coloneqq dL_{g^{-1}}\left(\textrm{grad}f_g\right)$ denote the trivialization of the gradient.
The gradient of $f$ can then be characterized as:</p>
<p>
\[
\begin{align*}
\langle \mathfrak{grad}f_\mu, \tilde Z \rangle = \langle dL_{\mu^{-1}}\left(\textrm{grad}f_\mu\right), \tilde Z \rangle = \langle \textrm{grad}f_{\mu}, \tilde Z \rangle = Zf(\mu).
\end{align*}
\]
</p>
<p>which should hold for an arbitrary $\tilde Z$.
We further decompose this function as $f= f_1 \circ f_2$ ($f_1$ <em>after</em> $f_2$) where $f_1:\mathfrak g \rightarrow \mathbb R_{\geq 0}$ and $f_2:G \rightarrow \mathfrak g$ in the obvious way. This means that</p>
