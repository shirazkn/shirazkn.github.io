<!-- ($1$) has a surprisingly useful visual interpretation as well. -->

<!-- to add: 
does language follow logic? statistically maybe, entropy (3b1b), tai-danae's paper, monte carlo, 
... but then anything with even the slightest amount of regularity is mathematical.
incompleteness theorems as languages.. -->

<!-- however, languages are informal, allow statements like this sentence is false. -->
<!-- Aside: would a language that is expressive enough to encapsulate mathematical logic be incomplete?
language allows us to transcend mathematical systems. -->
