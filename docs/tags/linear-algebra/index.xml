      <title>The Real World is a Special Case</title>

      <description>The title is a quote from Dr. Carol Jacoby&amp;rsquo;s math podcast . I mentioned in the last post that Euclidean geometry arises as a special case of the geometry of inner product spaces. And yet, the only spaces that are &amp;rsquo;tangible&amp;rsquo; to us humans are the $1$, $2$, and $3$ dimensional Euclidean spaces. No other inner product spaces feel nearly as intuitive.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;m showing how the Pythagoras theorem is a special case of a more general feature of inner product spaces.</description>

      <description>This is an explainer on norms, metrics, and inner products, and their relationships to each other.
Norms A norm is any real-valued function $\lVert{}\cdot{}\rVert$ (taking the elements of a corresponding vector space as its arguments), which has the following properties:
It is nonnegative, and $0$ only at the &amp;lsquo;zero element&amp;rsquo; (for e.g., at the origin of $\mathbb R^n$).
$\lVert \alpha x \rVert = |\alpha| \lVert x \rVert$ for any scalar $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>The Unreasonable Effectiveness of $2$ in Statistics</title>
      <link>https://shirazkn.github.io/posts/leastsquares/</link>

      <description>First off, this is a reference to The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences , a very popular paper by Eugene Wigner which explores how mathematics is unreasonably effective at not only explaining, but also predicting scientific phenomena. I had a similar question about the number $2$ which repeatedly shows up in engineering and science, specifically in the form of the $2$-norm of a vector, and seems surprisingly effective at doing what it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to do.</description>
