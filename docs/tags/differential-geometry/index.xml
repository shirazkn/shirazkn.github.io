      <title>The Levi-Civita Connection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here, I solve Problem $5-5$ from John Lee&amp;rsquo;s book on &lt;em&gt;Riemannian Manifolds&lt;/em&gt;, which demonstrates the non-flatness of the ($2$-)sphere. This problem is particularly interesting because it serves as the motivating example for a later chapter in the book on &lt;span class=accented&gt;curvature&lt;/span&gt;.
As a by-product, we will put to rest the concerns of flat-Earthers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;connections&#34;&gt;Connections&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I go over the technical tools needed to state (let alone solve) the problem.
A &lt;em&gt;connection&lt;/em&gt; $\nabla$ on a smooth manifold $M$ is a way of differentiating &lt;a href=&#34;https://shirazkn.github.io/posts/vector-fields&#34; class=&#34;accented&#34;&gt;
    vector fields
&lt;/a&gt; (and more generally, tensor fields) along curves in $M$:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lie Groups as Riemannian Manifolds</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;span class=accented&gt;Lie group&lt;/span&gt; $G$ is a group that is also a (continuous, differentiable) topological space. An example to keep in mind is $G=\mathbb R^n$ which is a group under vector addition and has well-defined notions of continuity and differentiation. To measure lengths and volumes (and relatedly, to define and integrate probability densities) we need to endow $G$ with additional structure so that it is not merely a manifold, but a &lt;span class=accented&gt;Riemannian manifold&lt;/span&gt;. Luckily for us, we only need to define an inner product for the Lie algebra, after which there is a natural definition of length and volume that can be made for the entire group manifold. I say that the resulting choice of volume (called the &lt;span class=accented&gt;Haar measure&lt;/span&gt;) is &lt;em&gt;natural&lt;/em&gt; because it is compatible with the group structure of $G$ as well as its differential structure as a manifold. This can be compared to how the standard notion of volume for $\mathbb R^n$, the Lebesgue measure, is compatible with vector addition; we have for a (measurable) set $A\subseteq \mathbb R^n$ and for every $\mathbf x_0 \in \mathbb R^n$,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lie Groups: Construction and Geometry</title>
      <link>https://shirazkn.github.io/posts/lie-groups_construction/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are multiple ways to construct new groups from old ones. For instance, the semidirect product $SO(3) \ltimes \mathbb R^3$ is the Special Euclidean group $SE(3)$, which is composed of all the rigid transformations of $\mathbb R^3$ (minus reflections). Here, I provide an intuition for how these constructions work. I will also go over some of the additional structures that can be imposed on Lie groups, paving the path towards doing differential geometry and calculus on Lie groups. While the word &lt;em&gt;geometry&lt;/em&gt; implies the presence of an inner product/Riemannian metric, the word &lt;em&gt;calculus&lt;/em&gt; hints at the possibility of differentiation and integration on Lie groups.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Lie Group-Lie Algebra Correspondence</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;span class=accented&gt;topological group&lt;/span&gt; is a set of elements $G$ that has both a group operation $\odot$ and a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62WNNkoRCLE&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;accented&#34;&gt;
    topology
&lt;/a&gt;. The group operation satisfies the usual axioms (same as &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/g7L_r6zw4-c?si=Y2Zit5muzZrCciaQ&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;accented&#34;&gt;
    those of finite groups
&lt;/a&gt;), and the presence of a topology lets us say things like &amp;rsquo;the group is connected&amp;rsquo; and &amp;rsquo;the group operation is continuous&amp;rsquo;. $G$ is called a &lt;span class=accented&gt;Lie group&lt;/span&gt; if it is also a smooth manifold. The smooth structure of the manifold must be &lt;em&gt;compatible&lt;/em&gt; with the group operation in the following sense: $\odot$ is differentiable with respect to either of its arguments &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The compatibility of its constituent structures is what makes a Lie group so special, enabling it to capture the essence of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;accented&#34;&gt;
    continuous symmetry
&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Vector Fields on Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://shirazkn.github.io/posts/vector-fields/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, I have struggled to pin down what the scope of my blog should be. There is plenty of exposition out there on just about every aspect of modern mathematics, but especially on &lt;span class=accented&gt;exterior calculus&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=accented&gt;differential geometry&lt;/span&gt; due to their situation at the intersection of several areas in theoretical and applied mathematics. (As a case in point, the two main references that I&amp;rsquo;ve been using to self-learn differential forms were the creations of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lovelock&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;accented&#34;&gt;
    theoretical physicist
&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;accented&#34;&gt;
    computer scientist
&lt;/a&gt;, respectively). So then what is the scope of my blog? Maybe it is for me to catalog the process of self-learning mathematics as an engineering major who lacks a curricular background in modern mathematics. Maybe it is to assure others like me (who are also privileged enough to learn mathematics in isolation of such material concerns as its &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;job prospects&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;) that it can be done. This post will do a bit of both; it serves in part the purpose of organizing my own thoughts on these matters, and in part the purpose of providing a roadmap for others who are interested in embarking on a similar journey.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
