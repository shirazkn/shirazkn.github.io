      <description>Here, I solve Problem $5-5$ from John Lee&amp;rsquo;s book on Riemannian Manifolds, which demonstrates the non-flatness of the ($2$-)sphere. This problem is particularly interesting because it serves as the motivating example for a later chapter in the book on curvature. As a by-product, we will put to rest the concerns of flat-Earthers.
Connections First, I go over the technical tools needed to state (let alone solve) the problem. A connection $\nabla$ on a smooth manifold $M$ is a way of differentiating vector fields (and more generally, tensors) along curves in $M$:</description>

      <description>A Lie group $G$ is a group that is also a (continuous, differentiable) topological space. An example to keep in mind is $G=\mathbb R^n$ which is a group under vector addition and has well-defined notions of continuity and differentiation. To measure lengths and volumes (and relatedly, to define and integrate probability densities) we need to endow $G$ with additional structure so that it is not merely a manifold, but a Riemannian manifold.</description>

      <description>There are multiple ways to construct new groups from old ones. For instance, the semidirect product $SO(3) \ltimes \mathbb R^3$ is the Special Euclidean group $SE(3)$, which is composed of all the rigid transformations of $\mathbb R^3$ (minus reflections). Here, I provide an intuition for how these constructions work. I will also go over some of the additional structures that can be imposed on Lie groups, paving the path towards doing differential geometry and calculus on Lie groups.</description>

      <description>A topological group is a set of elements $G$ that has both a group operation $\odot$ and a topology . The group operation satisfies the usual axioms (same as those of finite groups ), and the presence of a topology lets us say things like &amp;rsquo;the group is connected&amp;rsquo; and &amp;rsquo;the group operation is continuous&amp;rsquo;. $G$ is called a Lie group if it is also a smooth manifold. The smooth structure of the manifold must be compatible with the group operation in the following sense: $\odot$ is differentiable with respect to either of its arguments 1.</description>

      <description>Over the past year, I have struggled to pin down what the scope of my blog should be. There is plenty of exposition out there on just about every aspect of modern mathematics, but especially on exterior calculus and differential geometry due to their situation at the intersection of several areas in theoretical and applied mathematics. (As a case in point, the two main references that I&amp;rsquo;ve been using to self-learn differential forms were the creations of a theoretical physicist and a computer scientist , respectively).</description>
