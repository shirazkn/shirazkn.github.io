      <title>Representing Spatial Velocities</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been going through Russ Tedrake&amp;rsquo;s notes on robotics, which got me thinking about their so-called monogram notation. The result of this deliberation was a new notation for spatial velocities that bridges the gap between abstract Lie groups and their applications to robotics and computer graphics.</description>

      <title>Euler-Poincaré Equations</title>

      <description>Poincaré&amp;rsquo;s 1901 paper introduces (in just a humble 3 pages) the Euler-Poincaré equations, which are the specialization of the Euler-Lagrange equations to the case where a Lie group acts on the configuration manifold. I work through Poincaré&amp;rsquo;s paper without making too many identifications.</description>

      <title>Classical Mechanics on Manifolds</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite having encountered the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms of mechanics several times in a variety of engineering and physics settings, I had never been able to retain it in my memory. I had maintained a similar dissatisfaction with the many formulae of multivariable calculus, which only really ✨clicked✨ for me once I learned about the exterior derivative and the &lt;a href=https://youtu.be/1lGM5DEdMaw?si%3Dk9NhFF7jNBcaEoGQ class=accented&gt;generalized Stokes&amp;rsquo; theorem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I would like to collect my thoughts on the differential geometric treatment of &lt;span class=accented&gt;Lagrangian&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=accented&gt;Hamiltonian mechanics&lt;/span&gt;, which assume a very simple and memorable form once we introduce the language of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_geometry&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;accented&#34;&gt;
    symplectic geometry
&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, to have made our mathematical journey to this point, where we are able to say anything at all about symplectic geometry, was a not-so-simple task.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
