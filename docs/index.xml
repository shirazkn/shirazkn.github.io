      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about balls. Specifically, I want to look at unit balls corresponding to the different $p$-norms in $\mathbb R^n$, where $n$ is the dimension of the space. For a vector $v\in \mathbb R^n$, the $p$-norm is
\[ \|x\|_p \coloneqq \left(\sum_i |x_i|^p\right)^{\frac{1}{p}} \] When $p=2$ this is the usual Euclidean distance. The corresponding ball is what we think of when someone says ball, it is all the points that are within a given distance from the origin.</description>

      <title>The Real World is a Special Case</title>

      <description>The title is a quote from this math podcast . I mentioned in the last post that Euclidean geometry arises as a special case of the geometry of inner product spaces. And yet, the only spaces that are &amp;rsquo;tangible&amp;rsquo; to us humans are the $1$, $2$, and $3$ dimensional Euclidean spaces. No other inner product spaces feel nearly as intuitive.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;m showing how the Pythagoras theorem is a special case of a more general feature of inner product spaces.</description>

      <title>Norms, Metrics, and Inner Products</title>

      <description>This is an explainer on norms, metrics, and inner products, and their relationships to each other.
Norms A norm is any real-valued function $\lVert{}\cdot{}\rVert$ (taking the elements of a corresponding vector space as its arguments), which has the following properties:
It is nonnegative, and $0$ only at the &amp;lsquo;zero element&amp;rsquo; (for e.g., at the origin of $\mathbb R^n$).
$\lVert \alpha x \rVert = |\alpha| \lVert x \rVert$ for any scalar $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>The Unreasonable Effectiveness of $2$ in Statistics</title>
      <link>https://shirazkn.github.io/posts/leastsquares/</link>

      <description>First off, this is a reference to The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences , a very popular paper by Eugene Wigner which explores how mathematics is unreasonably effective at not only explaining, but also predicting scientific phenomena. I had a similar question about the number $2$ which repeatedly shows up in engineering and science, specifically in the form of the $2$-norm of a vector, and seems surprisingly effective at doing what it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to do.</description>

      <title>Cat Theory ðŸ˜¼</title>

      <description>One of my biggest motivations for starting a blog was Eugenia Cheng&amp;rsquo;s delightful book The Joy of Abstraction 1. It&amp;rsquo;s a surprisingly accessible, gentle introduction to category theory, a topic that is usually only taught to graduate students in math. She compiled part of the book using notes from the category theory class that she teaches at the Art Institute of Chicago, a testament to the aesthetic appreciation that one can expect to gain of category theory, irrespective of their academic background.</description>

      <title>The Incompleteness Theorems</title>

      <description>In my earlier post I suggested that there is no objective notion of logical truth, that whether a statement is &amp;rsquo;true&amp;rsquo; can depend on the system of truth that one is operating in. Here we will develop that argument further using the concept of axiomatic systems. This is a long one, but I&amp;rsquo;m excited to talk about it!
Axiomatic Systems An axiomatization is an assignment of rules (axioms) such as &amp;ldquo;one plus one equals two,&amp;rdquo; making up an axiomatic system or a formal system.</description>

      <title>Misuse as a Use of Language</title>

      <description>This post discusses the question of whether spoken and written languages like English could be &amp;rsquo;logical&amp;rsquo; by design, and why they aren&amp;rsquo;t. I will break this topic up into two posts. The first one (this post) does not require a mathematical background whatsoever, whereas the second touches on the concepts of axioms, theorems and proofs. Both parts are somewhat self-contained, so you can skip to the next post if you&amp;rsquo;d like.</description>
