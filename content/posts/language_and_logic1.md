This post concerns the question of whether spoken and written languages like English could be logically consistent by design, and why they aren't. It turns out there's two ways we can ask (and answer) this question. The first does not require a mathematical background whatsoever, whereas the second touches on the concepts of axioms, theorems and proofs. Both parts are somewhat self-contained, so you can [skip to part 2](/posts/language_and_logic2) if you'd like.

### <span class=tertiary>Part 1</span> &nbsp;Informal Logic

You've probably heard of logical fallacies such as the [false dilemma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma), which I believe is performed something like this:
<p class=equation-like>
<span class=print><b>Person 1:</b> Women and trans people are in need of better mental health infrastructure.<br>
<b>Person 2:</b> How can that be, when this statistic shows that it's mostly cis men who committed self harm in 2016?<br>
<b>Person 3:</b> Oh yeah? What about this other statistic about trans people which clearly states that...</span>
</p>

wherein Persons 2 and 3 are the culprits, for not recognizing that two things can be true at once. Of course, there isn't actually a dichotomy here; men need better mental health support systems encouraging them to process their feelings; trans people and women would benefit from policies that make it easier and safer for them to seek help. The false dilemma fallacy makes for great bipartisan politics. 

Perhaps more subtle in this regard are the logical fallacies that misdirect not necessarily in their written form, but through accent or *emphasis*. The [fallacy of accent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_accent) refers to how the interpretation of a sentence can be modified by emphasizing one word over another:

<p class=equation-like>
<span class=print> 
Trans people are in need of better mental health infrastructure.<br>
<span class=accented><i>Trans</i></span> people are in need of better mental health infrastructure.
</span>
</p>

The second sentence may be excluding the possibility that cis people need better mental health infrastructure. It suggests that, if there is a box labeled "people who need better mental health infrastructure," then it has room only for trans people. Whatever else you might have put into that box earlier is now gone.

Interestingly, the Wikipedia article for the false dilemma fallacy foreshadows the next arc of this post:

> Our liability to commit false dilemmas may be due to the tendency to simplify reality by ordering it through either-or-statements, which is to some extent already built into our language.

Whoever wrote this sentence suggests that fallacies are <span class=print>built into our language</span>. As a bit of a sidebar, last month, my mom demonstrated a mastery of the false dilemma, using it to win the silly argument that we were having. I couldn't help but marvel at how natural her suggestion seemed to me at the moment, when conveyed in the language we were conversing in &#8211; Urdu. 
If only we had been speaking English instead, I would have seen right through her ploy. 
Maybe it is because I use English and not Urdu to reason in my daily life. I have only ever spoken Urdu to my family, and I don't reason with my family (mostly because it's always a losing battle). Have I been conditioned into forgoing logical thinking while talking in Urdu? Or are fallacies not only <span class=print>built into our language</span> (whatever that means), but also vary in their nature and potency depending on the language and context that we're in?

The text [After Babel](https://www.bard.edu/library/arendt/pdfs/Steiner_AfterBabel.pdf) by George Steiner gives some credibility to the claim that fallacies may be built into languages. On page $231$, he describes how he thinks languages came into being:

> We speak first to ourselves, then to those nearest us in kinship and locale. We turn only gradually to the outsider, and we do so with every safeguard of obliqueness, of reservation, of conventional flatness or outright misguidance.

As human communities manufactured their languages, they did so with the express intent of obscuring any meaning to outsiders, to maintain secrecy. If anything, the ability to lie and misdirect with language has been critical to its popularization. Just as the politicians today use the false dilemma to garner support, so have those in power used logical fallacies to their advantage for thousands of years. The honest working-class person seldom wrote seminal historical texts, their language has not propagated through time quite as well. Only those with money, time, and/or inflated egos have had the luxury of writing influential texts. The punchline comes from page $224$ of Steiner:

> ... the uses of language for 'alternity', for mis-construction, for illusion and play, are the greatest of man's tools by far.

It is certainly one of my mom's greatest tools. 

### <span class=tertiary>The Bridge to Part 2</span> &nbsp;Proof by No Contradiction

Humans are organized into systems, communities that talk to each other in a certain language. Between two systems, languages, with all of their words, syntaxes, enunciations, and cultural connotations, can differ either slightly (Catholics v. atheists) or drastically (Urdu speakers v. English speakers).
Who's to say that what's illogical in one language isn't logical in another? When in the $1600$s Galileo suggested that the Earth went around the sun, he was <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/galileo-is-accused-of-heresy">called a heretic</a> for contradicting with the Catholic church's Earth-centric model of the world. It was false that the Earth went around the Sun. In a community where *everyone* believes in God, it is considered perfectly logical to ascribe the creation of the universe to God. 
There is no reason to *prove* it, because to a logician within this system, the theory that God created the universe is perfectly consistent with all the theories that came prior to it.
For the same reason, most physicists do not bother to prove that [time flows in one direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_of_time). They take the flow of time for granted while solving complex equations, secretly hoping that it doesn't lead them to any contradictions down the line. These are things we lay down as foundations for our worldview, and we always need to start *somewhere* in order to draw further inference. Once you are within a system, the *truth* of that system is anything that is consistent within the system. Inconsistency, i.e., contradicting with the aforementioned truths, is what is meant by being *false*.

In both mathematics and scientific deduction, contradictions are a major blow to the field, for it can be near-impossible to figure out where we went wrong. Sometimes it just means that we need to have an open mind and accept a new idea. Albert Einstein lived through at least three such events during his lifetime. The first was of his own doing, the realization that [spacetime curves and contorts in ways that are impossible for humans to visualize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#Geometry_of_the_universe_%28special_relativity%29). The second time, he was the one being unsettled by [a Danish physicist's spooky story about quantum physics]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr–Einstein_debates)).
The third blow came in the $1930s$, this time aimed straight for the very foundation of mathematics as it was known at the time. It was revealed that not only is *truth* subjective, but in fact some things that are neither *true* nor *false*. Sometimes things we believe are *true* will elude any proof. Mathematicians did not like that, the whole point of mathematics was to prove things and to be sure that we won't run into any contradictions. Mathematics was the *one* field that was supposed to be free of this sort of ambiguity.

Prior to these revelations, mathematicians had been sleeping peacefully in their beds, blissfully unaware that a man named [Kurt Gödel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Gödel) was undoing the screws off of their bedframe. In [the next post](/posts/language_and_logic2), we will see just what Gödel ([and some years later, Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing%27s_proof)) had to say to the world, and how his findings necessitate that natural language *should* be logically inconsistent if we are to do anything meaningful with it.
