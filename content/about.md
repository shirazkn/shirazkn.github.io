Like the many before me who have tried, I hope to make math-averse and math-agnostic people fall in love with this beautiful subject. This was the original purpose of the blog, with the [first few posts](/tags/general) written for a broad audience. The scope of the blog has changed dramatically over the course of its run, however. It now functions (in part) as a personal math diary. I often revisit my own posts for reference <span class=gray>(how was this thing defined again?)</span>, to reflect on pedagogical aspects <span class=gray>(I remember this being confusing...)</span>, or for an ego-boost <span class=gray>(look how far I've come!!)</span>.

The rest of my blog assumes familiarity with basic linear algebra (as it pertains to $\mathbb R^n$). Once that is attained, you may want to get a feel for [higher dimensions](/posts/balls) and the [geometric structures](/posts/norms_metrics) that can be defined on a vector space. [Hilbert spaces](/posts/hilbert-spaces) is a good next stop, but arguably the most illuminating posts here are those that define an [abstract vector space](/posts/vector) and reconcile it with the familiar program of [matrix multiplication](/posts/matrix); see the linear algebra [tag](/tags/) for more. Note that posts are displayed in reverse chronological order, and thus in reverse order of mathematical maturity.

Much of what I posted since was motivated by a desire to understand [manifolds](/tags/differential-geometry) (in particular, [Lie groups](/posts/lie-groups)).
My post on [vector fields on manifolds](/posts/vector-fields) has received critical acclaim among the 2 or 3 people who have read it closely. I am quite fond of [this post](/posts/lie-groups_construction) that discusses various constructions involving Lie groups, such as quotients, products, and [Riemannian metrics](/posts/lie-groups_riemannian). Recently, I have been learning about [harmonic analysis](/posts/harmonic-analysis) and [mechanics](/tags/mechanics). In the distant future, I'd like to get into the business of making math visualizations.

## About Me

This blog is maintained by me, an aerospace engineer by training. My research is broadly in the area of [control theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory). Besides being a math fanatic, I am an amateur musician, and have been rekindling my love of [cryptic crosswords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptic_crossword) lately.
