Like the many before me who have tried, I hope to make math-averse and math-agnostic people fall in love with this beautiful subject. This was the original purpose of the blog, with the [first few posts](/tags/general) written for a broad audience, but the scope of the blog has changed over the course of its run. It now functions as a personal math diary. I often revisit my own posts for reference <span class=gray>(how was this thing defined again?)</span>, to reflect on pedagogical aspects <span class=gray>(I remember this being confusing...)</span>, or for an ego-boost <span class=gray>(look how far I've come!!)</span>.

The rest of my blog assumes familiarity with basic linear algebra (as it pertains to $\mathbb R^n$). If you are coming from an undergraduate engineering background, you might want to get a feel for [higher dimensions](/posts/balls) and the [geometric structures](/posts/norms_metrics) that can be defined on a vector space. [Hilbert spaces](/posts/hilbert-spaces) is a good next stop, so are the posts that define [abstract vector spaces](/posts/vector) and reconcile it with the familiar program of [matrix multiplication](/posts/matrix); see the linear algebra [tag](/tags/) for more. Note that posts are displayed in reverse chronological order, and therefore in reverse order of mathematical maturity!

Much of what I've posted since was motivated by a desire to understand [manifolds](/tags/differential-geometry) (in particular, [Lie groups](/posts/lie-groups)).
My post on [vector fields on manifolds](/posts/vector-fields) has received critical acclaim among the 2 or 3 people who've read it closely. I am quite fond of [this one](/posts/lie-groups_construction) that discusses various constructions involving Lie groups, such as quotients, products, and [Riemannian metrics](/posts/lie-groups_riemannian). Recently, I have been learning about [harmonic analysis](/posts/harmonic-analysis), [mechanics](/tags/mechanics), and [fiber bundles](/posts/bundles). 
In the distant future, I'd like to get into the business of making math visualizations, and maybe a podcast?

This blog is maintained by [Shiraz Khan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shiraz-k) (me). I have a PhD in Aero/Astro from Purdue University and did my undergrad at IIT Madras. During the week, I work as a research scientist at a [robotics startup](https://www.tutorintelligence.com) located in Boston. [My research](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Shiraz-Khan) is broadly in the area of [control theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory) and [state estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_observer), and I spent two productive years working on Lie groups alongside [Gregory S. Chirikjian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_S._Chirikjian). 
Besides being a math fanatic, I am an amateur musician, and have been rekindling my love of [cryptic crosswords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptic_crossword) lately.
